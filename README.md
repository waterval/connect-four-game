# Connect Four

Connect Four is a game played by two players. They take turns in dropping a colored disc from the top into a grid until it hits the lowest available slot. A player has seven columns to choose from and can fill a total of six rows. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

The project exists so I can play Connect Four with my nephews and nieces who are a big fan of Pokemon. I hope this game will also bring as much joy in your life as it does to ours.
